<p style="text-align: justify;">Network cabinet is normally used for the storage of router, <a href="https://www.fs.com/c/racks-enclosures-1308" target="new">patch panel</a>, switch and a wide variety of networking equipment as well as networking accessories. In most cases a network cabinet will be shallower than a server rack cabinet. They are usually less than 31 inches in depth. Because thermal requirement is not typically an issue with the equipment stored in the network cabinet, they are more likely to have a glass or a strong plastic front door instead of a perforated one.</p>

<h2>What Is Server Rack Cabinet</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Server rack cabinet is mostly applied to install servers, UPS ES, monitors or similar equipment. It is available in a wide array of heights, widths and depths for rackmount compatibility in standard IT equipment. Take 42U server rack as an example, it is generally 24 inches wide and 36 inches deep by industry standards. Some companies can also offer other measurement options to meet various demands. This kind of cabinet usually has a perforated front and rear door for ventilation to maintain a suitable environment for the heat-generating equipment inside.</p>

<h2>Network Cabinet vs Server Rack Cabinet Differences</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">For the differences between network cabinet and server rack cabinet, you may get a basic impression and draw inspiration from what we have discussed above. Now let us make a summary about their major distinctions.</p>

<div>

 	<li><strong>Depth</strong></li>
</ul>
</div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Due to server rack cabinet is going to house network equipment that is longer, it must be deeper than network cabinet in depth. In a similar way, network cabinet is used to house routers, patch panels and other networking equipment, such as fiber optic cable, which requires significantly shorter in depth. There is often a difference of 800 mm to 1200 mm in terms of the depth.</p>

 	<li><strong>Airflow</strong></li>
</ul>
</div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Most servers will produce a considerable amount of heat. The type of equipment generally housed in network cabinet does not generate the same amount of heat as that housed inside a server rack. In order to help facilitate airflow over the hotter servers, a server rack cabinet is going to be designed out of a perforated material with vented fronts and backs. With regard to a network cabinet, the equipment housed inside does not generate much heat in comparison, so they are designed out of a solid tempered glass or Plexiglas for the front door and a solid material for the rear panel.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It is vital to look into the overall dimensions of the equipment that you use before you decide upon which is going to be the right choice. It is also important to notice that improperly housing heat generating equipment is dangerous, which could cause damage to your equipment. The most appropriate is the best.
